# Spell Checking Datasets

There are three dictionaries with English words to check spelling against:

- `ogden.dict` is tiny (and useless in practice) at 850 words
- `scowl-small.dict` is of a reasonably useful size at 50,078 words
- `scowl-large.dict` will find most problems reliably at 163,100 words

There are three example text files that should be spell-checked:

- `sanity.txt` is tiny (and useless for benchmarking) but the results
  `Spell.java` spits out are easily checked here
- `congo.txt` is still pretty short at 323,490 bytes, but it starts to
  be enough data for your first benchmarks
- `democracy.txt` is a decent size at 2,000,532 bytes, but depending
  on the numbers you get you may want to try even bigger inputs

There are also a number of `*.errors` files that contain the expected
output of `Spell.java` for the indicated combination of dictionary and
text input.
For example, `democracy_scowl-small.errors` has the output of checking
`democracy.txt` against the `scowl-small.dict` dictionary.

A quick way to check whether `Spell.java` using your `HashMap` class
works is to redirect the output to a file `myerrors` and then use the
`diff` tool:

```
$ diff myerrors democracy_scowl-small.errors
```

If the files match, `diff` makes no output; otherwise it will tell you
where the two files differ (which may help you track down the problem
in your code).
